/**
 * Represents contextual information used for cryptographic operations and secure service exchanges
 * in a protected environment.
 * <p>
 * A context represents a certain class of purpose of the protected protocol represented by a
 * specific client key pair. The primary role of separation of contexts is to allow the server
 * infrastructure to separate cryptographic operations based on the purpose of the protected
 * service, as well as to route protected objects to the appropriate server for processing.
 * <p>
 * Attributes: - kid: Represents the key identifier, typically used for identifying cryptographic
 * keys in a secure context. - signingParams: Encapsulates parameters required for JWS (JSON Web
 * Signature) signing, including the signer and algorithm details. - contextKeyPair: Contains the
 * cryptographic key pair associated with this context, including both the private and public keys
 * required for encryption, decryption, or signing operations.
